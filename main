We provide a HSR-P.xlsx from an HSR-JR680 industrial robot, which contains three sub-datasets corresponding to three planes. Each dataset contains 800 samples collected from a plane parallel to the ground, a plane at an angle of 45 degrees and a plane that to perpendicular to the ground. Note that each sample contains six joint angles (q1, q2, q3, q4, q5, q6 ), a corresponding cable length (L) and a reading of the dial indicator (D). We combine the HSR-P1, HRS-P2 and HRS-P3 into HRS-P.
